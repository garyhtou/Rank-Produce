###Inspiration
Each year, there are over 48 million people who experience symptoms from foodborne illnesses. In fact, over deaths due to foodborne illnesses. At Rank Produce, we believe that this is one of the major problems within our society. Food is a crucial aspect of our society. It is unacceptable that 5,000 people die each year from performing a necessary action of life.

###What it does
Rank Produce allow consumers to search the history timeline of any produce. It's a simple as downloading the app and scanning the UPC barcode of produce. This simple app will change your life.

###How we built it
Rank Produce as built as an Android app which uses Block chaining Technology (hashstaX)to it's advantage. Block chaining technology allows rank produce to ensure security and accurate information.

###Challenges we ran into
While building this app, we encountered many problems including setting up and implementing block chaining technology

###Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to provide a simple, but yet internally complex solution to allow everyone to ensure their own food safety.

###What we learned
Though creating this app, we have learned a lot out implementing blockchaining and hashstaX. This knowledge has allowed us to grow significantly.

Rank Produce is happy and excited to provide the public with such an amazing app!
